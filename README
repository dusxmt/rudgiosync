Rudgiosync - The Rudimentary GIO Synchronization utility.

Rudgiosync is a simplistic file synchronizing utility, inspired heavily by
rsync, which uses gio as its I/O library, and can therefore access and
synchronize gvfs-based filesystems.

Currently, the synchronizer only compares files based on their size, but
checksum-based comparison and timestamp-based comparison is planned as well.

While proper command-line argument handling is planned, currently, the program
expects two command-line arguments, the source and destination URIs identifying
the folders to be synchronized.  Example usage:

    $ rudgiosync "file:///tmp/sync/" "mtp://[usb:005,007]/SD card/sync/"
