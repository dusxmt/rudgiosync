Rudgiosync - The Rudimentary GIO Synchronization utility.


Rudgiosync is a simplistic file synchronizing utility, inspired heavily by
rsync, which uses gio as its I/O library, and can therefore access and
synchronize gvfs-based filesystems.

The synchronization utility compares files either by comparing their size
and time of last modification, or by only comparing their sizes, or optionally
by comparing the SHA256 checksums of the individual files.


The program expects two command-line arguments, the source and destination
locations to be synchronized (specified as a filename or a GIO-supported URI).

Additionally, you may specify which comparison criteria should apply, and
whether extraneous files from destination directories should be deleted; see
the help listing for more details:  rudgiosync --help


Example usage:

    $ rudgiosync -ds "/tmp/sync/" "mtp://[usb:005,007]/SD card/sync/"
